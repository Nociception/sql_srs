create a whole (multi lines) subject field in .sql exercise files, and a proper parsing for

test/explore the streamlit callback feature to check if it can solve the current session_state problems

SRS with manual user choices through buttons

add dus exercises

check if AS aliases affect comparisons (equals pandas' method)

harmonize session_state calls : only dict style, no more object style (even if both are available and equivalent)

add feature: hide exercise's theme (which can be an unwanted clue)

add text_area filler field (depands on the selex)

users

remove and make the exercises_list table generated from .sql files

stop tabs in text_area

add a field `difficulty`

docstrings TODO

replace all .df() with pl.Dataframe

auto scroll to query text_area

handle sql injection (organize tables in the duckdb database ; or maybe several duckdb databases)

unit tests

try again the initial plan : delete the solution tab, and add the alternating modes' (selection/resolution) buttons
